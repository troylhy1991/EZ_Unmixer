# EZ_Unmixer

1. EZ_Unmixer is a tool for quick spectal unmixing of two channel images.

      Master channel: the dominant channel
 
      Leakage channel: the corrupted channel

2. By sampling several leaked area, a spectral leakage ratio will be calculated;

3. leaked signal component will be subtracted from the Leakge channel.
